Madura cattle in the Sonok area are classified into Sonok, Taccek, and Conventional. Meanwhile, the selection of cattle with high economic value is expected to support environmentally friendly livestock production. Therefore, this study aims to identify candidate genes associated with economic traits for Madura Cattle in the Sonok area. An in-silico study was employed using data retrieved from published studies to obtain a list of genes that have been studied in Madura cattle. Next, genes were clustered using Venn Diagram for grouping into respective traits. The selected economic traits were growth, carcass, milk, and reproduction trait. The result showed that a total of 18 genes have been studied in Madura cattle. Among these genes, four were not associated with economic traits, while five were selected as candidate genes because they have associations with all four specified economic traits. The selected genes are Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1), Growth Hormone (GH), Growth Hormone Receptor (GHR), Myostatin (MSTN), and Leptin (LEP). These five genes can be used as molecular markers for economic traits. Following marker selection, a protein-to-protein interaction analysis and association study between the selected gene to economic trait needs to be performed in Madura Cattle within the Sonok Area.
