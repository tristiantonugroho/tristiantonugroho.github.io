Aim of this present study is to select microsatellites candidate that associated with reproductive trait for genetic selection in Indonesian Friesian Holstein dairy cattle. In total, 16 known microsatellites were obtained from Food and Agriculture Organization and recommended by International Society for Animal Genetics. Further, those microsatellites were selected based on the information which associated with reproductive traits in the published studies. As the result, 7 microsatellites namely ETH152, ETH225, BM2113, INRA032, BM1824, BM1818 and MM12 were associated with calving ease, non-return rate and twinning. Following candidate selection, an association study is the further step to validate this result.
