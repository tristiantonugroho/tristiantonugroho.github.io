Our previous study found five genes consist of Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), Growth hormone (GH1), Growth hormone receptor (GHR), Myostatin (MSTN), and Leptin (LEP) are responsible for the economic traits of Madura Cattle. This paper aimed to identify the protein-to-protein interaction of genes responsible for the economic traits of Madura Cattle. In silico study was done using STRING v.11.5 with Bos taurus IGF1, GH1, GHR, MSTN, and LEP as input analysis. Results show 24 biological processes, 3 molecular functions, and 6 KEGG pathways as potential protein interactions between genes. All genes are involved in six biological processes i.e. response to the hormone, response to oxygen-containing compound, cell surface receptor signalling pathway, regulation of signal transduction, positive regulation of the cellular metabolic process, and positive regulation of the macromolecule metabolic process. Five genes were predicted as functional partner genes, namely Leptin receptor (LEPR), Tyrosine-protein kinase receptor (INSR), Activin receptor type-2b precursor (ACVR2B), Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), and Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3). Based on the results, we can demonstrate the protein-to-protein interaction of IGF-1, GH, GHR, MSTN, and LEP genes which are potentially related to each other. Further experimental study is required to validate the interaction.
