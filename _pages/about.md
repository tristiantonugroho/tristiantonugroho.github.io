I earned a Bachelor's degree from Universitas Sebelas Maret and a Master's degree in Animal Science from Universitas Gadjah Mada. My previous research focused on animal production, livestock production systems, and genetic variation in local animal traits. Current research interests include animal behavior and welfare, data science, bioinformatics, and computational animal science.

Current Project
======
Currently leading research on the behavior and welfare of Belgian Blue crossbred cattle raised under Indonesian tropical environmental conditions, with a focus on their adaptation and well-being in open housing systems. Additionally, conducting a study on the growth performance and production traits of Boer goat crossbreeds to evaluate their potential for meat production. Furthermore, involved in a genomic study exploring the genetic diversity of Indonesian local livestock and their potential for genetic improvement.
