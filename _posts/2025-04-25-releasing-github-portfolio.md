Today, Friday, 25 April 2025, I officially release this GitHub Portfolio.
I began using this account to store code related to research data analysis.
My previous projects were sufficiently handled using Excel and R for data processing.
However, since the end of 2023, I've been involved in genomic and animal behavior research, which requires managing more complex datasets and workflows.
