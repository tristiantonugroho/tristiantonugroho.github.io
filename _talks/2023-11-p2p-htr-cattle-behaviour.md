Serotonin, also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), plays a crucial role in a wide range of physiological functions. This paper aims to analyze the protein-to-protein interactions within the serotonin receptor family and its role in cattle behavior. Thirteen serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR1B, HTR1D, HTR1E, HTR1F, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR3A, HTR4, HTR5A, HTR6, HTR7) were used in this study. First, we compared the profile of each serotonin receptor protein in Bos taurus, Bos indicus, and Bos taurus × indicus. Subsequently, these profiles were used as input in the STRING database for protein-to-protein interaction analysis. A biological process related to cattle behavior was selected. The results showed diverse serotonin receptor proteins among cattle species, with HTR3A playing a significant role in mediating their interactions. The interactions related to behavior included the serotonin receptor signaling pathway, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway coupled to cyclic nucleotide second messenger, regulation of biological quality, adenylate cyclase-inhibiting serotonin receptor signaling pathway, blood vessel diameter maintenance, vasoconstriction, and regulation of behavior. Four serotonin receptor (HTR1A, HTR1B, HTR1D, HTR2B) were involved in regulation of ‘behaviour’ biological processes. In conclusion, the serotonin receptor family was diverse among cattle species and played a crucial role in cattle behavior.
