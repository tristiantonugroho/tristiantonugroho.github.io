The Dopamine Receptor (DR) family, which is divided into five subtypes (D1, D2, D3, D4, D5), is implicated in various neurological processes. This paper aimed to analyze the role of the DR family in cattle behavior through an in silico study. Several steps of analysis were carried out. Initially, the five subtypes of DR (DRD1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, and DRD5) were filtered from the 'Behavior' or GO:0007610 biological process annotation in the Gene Ontology database (https://geneontology.org/). Subsequently, the fifth DR on Bos taurus and Bos indicus Ã— Bos taurus (hybrid cattle) were used as inputs for protein-to-protein interaction analysis using the STRING database (https://string-db.org/). Finally, a similarity check of DR nucleotides and proteins among Bos taurus, Bos indicus, and hybrid cattle was done using BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Results showed that the DR family was associated with 29 types of 'Behavior' biological processes in various species. In Bos taurus, the DR protein interactions were divided into two clusters, DRD5-DRD1-DRD2 and DRD3-DRD4. However, in hybrid cattle, all DRDs interacted with each other. Four DRs (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, DRD5) were found to interact in the 'Behavior' biological process in both Bos taurus and hybrid cattle. The nucleotides and proteins of the DR family in the three types of cattle showed more than 99% similarity, except for the DRD3 in hybrid cattle. It is concluded that the DR family plays an important role in cattle behavior. Further association studies are needed to proof this result.
